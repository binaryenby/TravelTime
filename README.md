# TravelTime
### Program that makes use of Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest travel time between two stations in the London Underground given by the user.

This is at its core a somewhat specialized implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, although any properly formatted data set could be swapped in and work just fine, so
any system that can be represented by a weighted graph with named vertices could be used with this program.

The initial Graph and Vertex files were provided by Dr. Chris Healy as part of an assignment, but have been modified pretty extensively by me to add functionality.
The data file stations.txt was also provided by him and has not been modified at all. The Driver file is entirely written by me.
